Secure Chat Application in C# ASP.NET with SQL Server

This Secure Chat Application is a real-time web-based messaging platform developed using C#, ASP.NET (Web Forms or Core), and SQL Server for robust data storage. Designed with a focus on user privacy and secure communication, the application enables users to register, log in, and exchange encrypted messages within a protected environment.

Key features include:

User Authentication & Authorization: Secure login system with hashed passwords (SHA-256 or similar) and role-based access control.

Encrypted Messaging: Messages are encrypted using XOR, AES, or similar encryption algorithms to ensure confidentiality both in transit and at rest.

Real-Time Communication: Leveraging technologies like SignalR or Ajax for instant message delivery and live updates.

Session Management: Automatic logout after inactivity, with optional timeout warnings to protect user sessions.

User Presence Tracking: Displays real-time user status (online/offline) using timers and session tracking.

Chat History: Stores message history in SQL Server with timestamps and optional read receipts.

User Profile Management: Allows users to update their display names, change passwords or PINs, and upload profile pictures.

Scalable & Modular: Built on a modular architecture that supports future expansion such as group chats, file sharing, and mobile app integration.

The application is ideal for organizations or individuals requiring a private and secure communication platform, combining the flexibility of ASP.NET with the reliability of SQL Server.
